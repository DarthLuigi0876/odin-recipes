    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Hot chocolate, also known as hot cocoa or drinking chocolate, is a heated
      drink consisting of shaved or melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated
      milk or water, and usually a sweetener. It is often garnished with whipped
      cream or marshmallows. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is
      sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a
      thicker consistency.
